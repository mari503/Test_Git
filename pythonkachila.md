### Title: 
### “Development of Graphene-Conductive Polymer Nanocomposites for Enhanced Electrochemical Energy Storage and Nanosensing Applications” 
1. Introduction and Background 
The global shift toward sustainable energy and advanced diagnostics has fueled growing interest 
in the development of novel materials for energy storage and sensing technologies. As 
conventional energy sources become increasingly unsustainable, there is a pressing need for 
more efficient energy storage solutions such as supercapacitors and highly sensitive 
electrochemical sensors for real-time environmental and biomedical monitoring. 
Among emerging materials, graphene has garnered remarkable attention since its first successful 
isolation from graphite by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov in 2004. However, graphene faces practical limitations most notably, the tendency of graphene 
nanosheets to agglomerate and restack, which reduces their effectiveness in real-world 
applicationsi. 
On the other hand, conducting polymers such as polypyrrole (PPy), polyaniline (PANi), and 
polythiophene (PTh) have shown great promise in gas sensing. These polymers offer high 
sensitivity and rapid response at room temperature, outperforming many conventional metal 
oxide-based gas sensors. Their chemical and physical properties can be easily tuned by 
introducing various substituents, and they can be synthesized through relatively simple chemical 
or electrochemical processes—making them attractive for sensor fabrication.
